Prerequisites
=============
The Fuse or Unified UI Framework can be used to develop jaggery applications running within any WSO2 product containing the Jaggery runtime such
as the WSO2 Application Server.

Getting Started
===============
1. Clone this repo: https://github.com/manuranga/fuse.git
2. Change the name of the fuse folder to the name of your application 
3. Select a WSO2 Product containing the Jaggery runtime such as WSO2 Application Server
4. Copy the folder to the 
    {CARBON_PRODUCT_HOME}/repository/deployment/server/jaggeryapps directory
5. Navigate to https://localhost:9443/fuse/ (or if you have changed the name navigate to: https://localhost:9443/{your-app-name})

This repo doubles as both the framework repository as well as a sample.The framework source code is found in the libs folder while the rest of
the folders provide scaffolding for a sample application.

Elements of the framework
===========================
A Fuse application consists of three main components:

1. Layouts
2. Pages
3. Units (Components)

The following image shows the organization of the application structure in relation to the above components
![resource success](docs/imgs/image03.png)

###Layouts
A layout file describes the structure of a page and relative locations where UI elements can be plugged in.These UI elements are
defined as Units.

![resource success](docs/imgs/image01.png)

The layout defines the zones that can house content in the form of units (components).A zone is defined by the layout author.

A zone can be thaught of as areas where key pieces of content of a page reside.An example of this is shown in the figure below where zone A houses a logo and zone C houses a menu and so on.

###Pages
A page can be accessible by a url and most importantly marries a layout with a set of components.

![resource success](docs/imgs/image04.png)

###Units (Components)
A unit may encapsulate a set of business logic ,resources needed to render a UI element or resources required by an entire page.It is apt to think of units (components) as the building blocks of a page.
* Example of a unit providing resources to a page: https://github.com/manuranga/fuse/tree/master/units/bootstrap/public
* Example of a unit modeling an UI element: https://github.com/manuranga/fuse/tree/master/units/am-publisher-logo

The relationship between units (components) and a layout is highlighted below:

![resource success](docs/imgs/image00.png)

A unit (component) consists of four main elements:

####{unit-name}.json
Allows a unit (component) to inherit from another unit (component) by defining an extend property
Allows a scope (predicate) to be defined for the component by using the predicate property 

####{unit-name}.js
When a unit (component) is loaded this script is executed and may contain server side initialization logic

####{unit-name}.hbs
Contains the UI representation as a Handlebars template.Please refer to  http://handlebarsjs.com/ for a detailed guide on working with the Handlebars syntax.

####public folder
Contains images,css and other resources neccessary to render a UI element


Tooling
=======
We have written a yeoman generator that will ease the creation of framework components such as pages, layouts and units (components).The generator-uuf 
is available at: https://github.com/splinter/generator-uuf
